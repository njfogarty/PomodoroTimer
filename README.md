# PomodoroTimer
A simple command-line driven timer especially designed for the pomodoro technique. 

This program is written in C#, and currently only available in release form for Windows.

Building the code for either OSX or Linux would be a trivial process for someone who isn't inexperienced like myself, and would likely only need some minor changes in how Console.Beep() is used, however considering the novelty of this program I doubt anyone would consider it worthwhile.
